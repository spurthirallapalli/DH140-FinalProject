    "- [ ] Importing, cleaning, organizing, merging, and processing the data using pandas and/or other python libraries\n",
    "- [ ] Basic statistical analysis that includes at least a set of descriptive statistics and informative plots of the data (such as scatter plots, histograms, bar plots, box plots, etc)\n",
    "- [ ] You must utilize at least one Python library outside Pandas that we have covered in our study of data visualization, mapping, web scraping, APIs, text analysis, statistics, basic machine learning, and network analysis\n",
    "- [ ] Tell the story of your analysis in 1500+ words (not including tables, figures, captions, or references).\n",
    "- [x] Be organized into four sections. (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)\n",
    "- [ ] The top of your notebook must include your name(s), the date, and your project title.\n",
    "- [ ] If you are working in a group, the end must describe each group member's contribution to this final project (one sentence each).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook for your blog site\n",
    "- [ ] Present your analysis and narrative without the fluff\n",
    "- [ ] The notebook/blog should be very similar to your project notebook with the exception that it should hide trivial code (such as exploratory analysis and plotting) and remove narrative unnecessary to addressing your primary question.\n",
    "- [ ] Nontrivial code (including library imports, data preparation steps, and key data analysis/plotting code) should still be included."

It’s a way for musicians to figure out which kind of music allows them to connect with different audiences and cross cultural and linguistic barriers. It’s also a way for us as listeners to help determine what connects us to certain kinds of music, what word frequencies and thematic patterns matter most to us, and what cultural practices and norms cause certain groups to listen (or not to listen) to certain types of music. Essentially, it’s a way to determine what connects us all!"
