    "**Why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake:** Music is something that everyone connects to, and our group wants to find a way to measure how and why music is spread across the world. It’s a way for musicians to figure out which kind of music allows them to connect with different audiences and cross cultural and linguistic barriers. It’s also a way for us as listeners to help determine what connects us to certain kinds of music, what word frequencies and thematic patterns matter most to us, and what cultural practices and norms cause certain groups to listen (or not to listen) to certain types of music. Essentially, it’s a way to determine what connects us all!"

The top 200 songs of each day or week and their total streams are available to download in csv format from Spotify Charts. The data can be found at https://spotifycharts.com/. \n",
